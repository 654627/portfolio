       <strong> Hi, my name is Rabie and I am 16 years old. I was born on April 30, 2004.
        <br>
        <br>  don't know much about coding but I do have experience coding a game that I made in Pygame.
        <br>
        <br> Some things I like are technology like phones and computers.
        <br>
        <br> I also enjoy playing video games like Halo and Call of Duty. I own an Xbox One and a Playstation 5.
        <br>
        <br> When it comes to school, my interests lie in computer courses like this one and computer engineering 
        <br>
        <br> but I also have an interest in business, not knowing if I like one or another yet.
        <br>
        <br> When it comes to my future, I am not sure what to pursue in the future, not knowing where I am going
        <br>
        <br> or what I am learning but I do think it will be something in business or computers or maybe both, 
        <br>
        <br> but for now, that is where I am learning computer programing and making a website.

      <strong> I really do like gaming a lot. I've been gaming since I was like 9 even though 
        <br>
        <br>
           till I was like 15 [still do though :( ], but the whole time I've been gaming, 
        <br>
        <br>
        it was on the Xboxs that I have had the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, so like for the last
        <br>
        <br>
        8 years and now, I have moved to the Playstation 5 and I'm reallyexcited to play on a
        <br>
        <br>
        different platform for the next few years for the first time. In short, I just really like games.
